# Reasoning Under Uncertainty – Practical Works (TPs)

This repository contains a collection of practical works (TPs) focused on **reasoning under uncertainty**, a key topic in Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation.  
The project explores several theoretical frameworks used to model, represent, and reason with **imprecise, incomplete, or uncertain information**.

The repository is mainly intended for **academic use** (university coursework, labs, or self-learning).
